Quirk is a tool for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is one of the most effective and widely prescribed treatments for depression, anxiety, panic disorder, and multiple other mental health problems.  

Quirk helps you record "automatic thoughts," challenge them, and then train your brain with an alternative thought.

World Health Organization (WHO) data reveals that ONE in FOUR people are affected by mental health issues like anxiety and depression.
Which means almost 25% of the world population are suffering with mental health issues.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT is a practice used by psychologists to help people improve their mental health.
CBT is known to have helped treat people with anxiety and depression - two very common mental health problems which are ailing a large portion of our society today.
CBT is however expensive, so some expert developers developed an app called "Quirk".

What is this Quirk app? 
Quirk is designed to be an aid in recording, becoming more aware of and changing your thought patterns - techniques used in CBT.
This app is very interesting and useful for people who have mental issues.

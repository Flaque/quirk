/**
 * Stupid, crazy things can happen when you're storing data on a user's device.
 *
 * If a user _ever_ incorrectly stores data wrong, it can cause wild, unfixable
 * issues for a user. This file serves as the last line of defense against corrupted data.
 *
 * You may be thinking:
 * > Woah, woah, doesn't ‚ú®TypeScript‚ú® protect us against invalid objects?
 *
 * Answer: no. In fact, TS can lure you into a false sense of security. TS compiles to
 * regular JS and only validates at compile time! This helps validate objects at _runtime_.
 *
 * You may also wonder:
 * > Woah woah woah why don't you just use a validation library?
 *
 * Answer: I can't find one that's actually more effective than checking for what I need.
 * I tried a bunch and they all had unrurly awful problems. ü§∑‚Äç

# CBT is well studied

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is **the "gold standard" of psychotherapy** and is widely considered to be one of the most effective, evidence backed treatments for depression, anxiety, and panic. CBT is used by almost every modern therapist and has been the "go-to" for many years. 

Like physical therapy, CBT is exercise and goal based. It's something you have to practice. CBT isn't something you read about and then all of a sudden feel better; you have to actively do the exercises. 

It takes time.

# Negative thoughts cause your mood

The primary premise of CBT is that your thoughts cause your mood. They're obviously not the *only* cause; sleep, diet, and exercise can all have quite significant effects. But your thoughts and world view are powerful forces in shaping your day-to-day mood.

Your brain is *really* good at making you feel exactly what you're thinking.

# Negative thoughts can compound on each other

To see how this happens, let's imagine you're job-hunting. You just finished an interview and they gave you a tough final question that you weren't sure how to answer.

After the interview, you keep repeating that experience in your head. You start by thinking "I *know* I failed that interview, I must have screwed up on that question." Before you realize it, you're thinking "What if this happens in the next interview, I'll probably fail that one too. I'm gonna fail all my interviews!" Which then leads you to think "Oh god, if I fail all these interviews, I must just be stupid. I'm probably not even right for this career path, I should just give up."

It's not uncommon for this type of thought pattern to happen quickly, each thought happening only minutes or even seconds after the previous. At the end, you're likely feeling terrible.
 
This process is called "Catastrophizing" and it's quite common, even for folks who aren't diagnosed with any particular mental illness. But that doesn't mean it has to keep happening to you.

# These thoughts are automatic

In some cases, you can cause a thought to happen. For example, if you say the words "I'm a purple elephant bear" in your head, you're causing that thought to happen. When you do that, you can pretty clearly tell that you're *not* a purple elephant bear, not only because it's absurd, but because you *chose* to think it.

In our interview example, it's likely that you didn't set out to think each of these thoughts. Instead, they just "happened." Mental health professionals call these "automatic thoughts."

# These thoughts aren't "true"

Until we hear back, is it really possible to tell if we "failed" an interview? It's likely not; we can't tell the future. People are historically quite bad at predicting future events. It's also certainly not true that failing a single interview will cause you to fail more interviews. 

These thoughts are _distorted_: they're not correct or logical. But these thoughts can happen so fast that we generally don't even notice until we're already feeling quite terrible.

# You can learn to challenge automatic negative thoughts in the moment

By challenging your thoughts in the moment, you can learn to not immediately buy any automatic negative thought that comes in. It requires practice, but it can help you become more mentally resilient and feel better overall.

Quirk is built to help you challenge thoughts. **Read "How to use Quirk" to learn more.**

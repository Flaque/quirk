# Labeling üè∑

Anytime we assign a word like "jerk" or "failure" to ourselves, others, or a situation, we're labeling.

Labeling is a form of overgeneralization and all-or-nothing thinking. In fact, labels are often the easiest way to recognize these distortions.

    `
Labels are generally oversimplifications. If someone brushed us off, they might not be a "jerk," maybe they're just in a hurry. If we made a single mistake, that doesn't mean we're a "failure."

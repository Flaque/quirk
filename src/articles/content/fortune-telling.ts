# Fortune Telling ðŸ”®

Fortune Telling is predicting something will happen in the future.

The worst fortune tellers will heavily overestimate the amount of evidence they have predicting their future. They may believe with absolute certainty that they'll "fail" tasks and use this to justify not attempting. They may overwhelm themselves with anxiety over problems that are both far in the future and may never occur.

    `
Fortune Tellers may use past experiences to "prove" that their predictions will come true. As any economist will tell you, _past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future results._

Just because you've failed a test in the past does not mean you'll fail the one coming up. Just because you were rejected by a romantic partner in the past does not mean you'll be rejected in the future.

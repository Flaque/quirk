# Use Quirk in the moment.

The best time to use Quirk is _immediately_ after you've had a **negative** automatic thought. This helps build the habit of "I had a negative thought, I should challenge it."

This requires a lot of awareness on your part. It can be a bit hard for new folks. The best trick we've found is that you should use Quirk when you notice your mood dropping. Even if you can't connect it to a thought immediately, feeling angry, upset, sad, or anxious is a good indicator that Quirk can help.

# _Challenge_, don't just record.

Quirk isn't really a mood journal, nor is it really a journal at all. It's designed to help you _challenge_ the thoughts, not just record them. When you use Quirk for awhile, you'll have a whole lot of proof that you can get through whatever you're currently dealing with.

# Seperate yourself from your automatic thoughts.

Automatic thoughts aren't really "you" anymore than you are your heartbeat or breath. But they tend to "play a movie" in your head that engages the rest of your body. You might imagine something quite terrible happening and all of a sudden you're sweating and your hearts racing. It feels like you experienced it, even when you didn't. 

If, in the moment, you can recognize that you're not "in that movie" and that actually you're just watching it, you get an opening to directly challenge the validity of whatever you're thinking. _This_ is your moment to use Quirk. 

In other words, if you made some mistake at work and you're imagining your boss walking in and firing you, you're watching a movie. If you can take a moment to pause and step out of the proverbial theater, you get a golden opportunity to challenge your thought.

  `
# This really is a skill.

And skills take awhile to build up. 

You might mess up, you might miss some automatic thoughts or not know how to challenge them in the moment. That's normal and that's fine. If you haven't considered a therapist before, you might want to consider it.

# There's more information out there than Quirk.

We recommend the book "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy" by David Burns. It's one of the best books on CBT and can help explain much more of the rational behind Quirk.

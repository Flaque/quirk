# Emotional Reasoning ðŸŽ­

"I feel it, therefore it must be true."

If you find yourself justifying the "danger" of something innocuous because you're afraid of it, you're likely engaging in Emotional Reasoning. If a small amount of fear means you're _absolutely_ about to have a panic attack, you're engaging in Emotional Reasoning.

## A note on difficulty

Emotional Reasoning can be quite hard to recognize, since it can cloud our ability to look for real evidence about the situation. For example, you may be insecure about your performance at work, which could lead you to justify taking less opportunities as they arise. Taking the opportunities might provide more evidence about your actual ability, but you avoid them due to the insecurity.

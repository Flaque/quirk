  `# What's Awareness? 

Challenging thoughts in the moment is hard. It requires an awareness of your thoughts that takes practice to build up. 

To help, we've created the Awareness score. It shows you the rough likelihood that you'll challenge any negative thought in the moment. You can also think about it as the "strength" of your thought-challenging habit. 

This really is a _skill_ you have to build up and the Awareness graph will help you see your progress over time.

  `# How Awareness works 

When you challenge thoughts, make predictions, or follow-up later, your awareness score will go up since CBT is likely top of mind. 

Like any skill, Awareness will naturally drop over time without regular practice. This is natural and just part of the experience.

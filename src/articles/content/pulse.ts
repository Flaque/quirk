  `# What's Awareness? 

The Awareness graph is a rough measure of how likely you are to challenge a negative thought. Often, automatic negative thoughts consume your thinking before you even become aware of them. With practice, you can become more aware in the moment. To do so, you'll need to build a habit that you may not be used to. To help, the Awareness chart will show you the strength of your habit over time.

  `# How Awareness works 

When you challenge thoughts, make predictions, or follow-up later, your awareness will go up since CBT is likely top of mind. Like any habit, Awareness will naturally drop over time. This is natural and just part of the experience.

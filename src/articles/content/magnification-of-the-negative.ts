# Magnification of the Negative ðŸ‘Ž

If we're judging a situation based entirely on the negative parts and not considering the positive parts, we're likely magnifying the negative. If weâ€™re constantly berating ourselves for bombing a job interview, we're probably filtering out all the experience we gained from that interview.`,

    `
## Examples

"I ate well this week, but I didn't exercise, so I'm so unhealthy."

"My boss said I did well, but I know I messed up."

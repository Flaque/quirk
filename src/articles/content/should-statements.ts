# Should Statements âœ¨

If you're assigning someone or something abilities they don't have, you're using "should" statements. For example, if you have a fear of flying and are telling yourself "I shouldn't be afraid of this, there's nothing wrong with the airplane!" you're putting an undue burden on yourself. You have a fear of flying! It's normal for people who have a fear of flying to be afraid flying!

Some Should Statements can seem nonsensical when you say it out loud; that's the point!

    `

Should statements can also be a sign of extreme unreasonable of yourself or others. You may think that you should be the best at your job, but this isn't necessarily true. Most people aren't the best; by definition, only one person can be! There's no universal requirement that it's got to be you.

If someone's rude to you, you may think:

They should have been more polite."

But why should they? Some people are not polite and it doesn't have to effect you.

Removing Should Statements from your life means accepting things for what they are and not necessarily what they should be.

## Examples

"I should be getting better faster."

"I'm an adult, I shouldn't have these issues."

"They should be here on time."

/**
 * This is Quirk's public stats file and is part of
 * how we do things.
 *
 * Quirk should be open; code _and_ stats. Typically,
 * a developer gets stats through the app stores, and even
 * if the app is open source, those stats tend to be kept
 * private.
 *
 * Quirk's not gonna be like that. Instead, aggregate stats
 * will be shared publicly, as long as it protects the privacy
 * of the user.
 *
 * That let's community members:
 * - understand the status of the project
 * - see the fruits of their support
 *
 * Plus, it allows researchers and mental health professionals
 * access the info in order to develop better treatments.
 *
 * These stats were created by you, the user.
 * **So you, the user, should have access to it.**
 *
 * (Note: we don't necessarily share all financial info
 * publicly due to legal + company risk)
